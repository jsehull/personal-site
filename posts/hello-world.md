Shout out to [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) for her tutorial on [setting up a markdown blog w/Netlify and Next.js](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/04/building-a-markdown-blog-with-next-9.4-and-netlify/).

Think about this, when have we ever let our **"hello world"** declarations hit production? I'm not sure if I ever have. So, here it is.

This is officially one of the rare shoutouts embeded in a `hello-world.file` buried deep on the internets that gets buried even deeper behind actually useful and relevant content/work ha.

### Section test

My next goal is to plug in _Netlify CMS_ and give the **draft + review + publish** setup a try. I DO like typing in Markdown, but I know I can do it there too. We'll see how it goes!

Trying to adjust CSS as I go...still other things to do yet!

You are lucky to even be doing this for us can you make it pop I really think this could go viral.

Ipsum can be fun.
