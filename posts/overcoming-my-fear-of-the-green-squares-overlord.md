I put a lot of effort over the years into learning web development. The sources I have used have ranged from courses, projects, on the job learning, to reading different blogs and educational materials.

And yet, I always felt obligated to prove that I'm learning. I still try to show it though! (Most of you will recognize the GitHub contribution picture in the banner above.) While important, we can't let it define our progress. This post is meant to encourage others and remind fellow developers what matters.

Feeling pressure from the _Green Squares Overlord_ (re: image above) just [leads to burnout](https://twitter.com/rwieruch/status/1265773491908993025). I'm not going to try to keep it green every day.

**I'm proud of the work I have been doing _consistently_ and I want to say that you should be too.**

(This post does not support laziness or negligence ðŸ˜….)

## You aren't the sum of your evidence

It's hard looking for jobs and transitioning. I'm there right now. It's easy to feel pressure to have lots of evidence and the magic bullet that will satisfy the job descriptions or will gain the respect of a brand or partnership you are pursuing.

But, we aren't just numbers. And neither are our efforts. It's nice to quantify activity. Repository contributions, tweeting, blogging, creating videos, and posting other places are a _great_ way to showcase your developer activity. And that's critical for personal growth and exposure.

These methods also aren't for everyone (time in the day, priorities, commitments, style, resources, etc.) Do what you can with what you have in the season you're in.

**Be proud of your work and progress. Showcasing/justifying it doesn't define your value.**

We offer way more than just a knowledge of flexbox or for loops. Popular tweets by industry veterans commonly share about the importance of work life balance and how **truly valuable developers are those who are also good with people**.

Anyone can learn, so keep doing that, but don't forget _you are the prize_ that a company hires. Not just your developer skills.

Do the work, grow as a developer. Don't stop growing as a person. Don't stop learning better communication or how to see from "the other department's" or shareholder's point of view.

## Convince yourself that you've done the work

If you don't believe it about yourself, no one will or should. We're aiming for honesty here, people.

If we actively are engaged in technical or professional discussions and up to date on features, concerns, environments, new technology and opportunities, etc, then employers are going to know that when they talk to us.

If you ARE representing yourself well, trust that _those who know, will know_. Game respect game.

If you ARE NOT representing yourself well, ...well, build good habits! Build a brand! **Be someone a company is proud to have on their roster**. Pretend an investor or important figure views all of your profiles and activity. Think of their response. You want to be someone your team is proud to have representing them.

[Don't feel bad](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1301439686074826753?s=20) for having priorities and other important activities. Sacrificing other important areas of our lives isn't going to be the difference maker. **Your genuine efforts will hold up when the time comes.**

## It's worth finding someone that values you

I believe this is honestly the most important part: **We must continue to see our character and abilities as our overall value and brand.** Not just our 1337 developer skills.

Hopefully we are communicating this properly through the right channels (LinkedIn, Twitter, personal sites, projects, etc) and making it easy for others to understand who we are and what we do. That means it's not up to just grinding out more and more and more development work.

If that's all handled, then we have to _trust in the process_. I've been in tough spots before. I know a job is a job and sometimes we take them when we need them. That doesn't mean we can't stand by who we are.

Don't be afraid to take a step back and give yourself some credit and say, **"I deserve a chance to find a company/partnership that truly values me and I truly value them."**

You're doing the work. They are looking for someone doing the work. Keep putting yourself in view for the right people.

_Green Squares Overlord_ to learning to finding a company? It's all very related for me. I was being harsh on myself near "Step 1" because I truly desire the final outcome: better opportunity.

We don't have to beat ourselves up. We don't have to grind into dust. We don't have to sacrifice important relationships or activities in an unreasonable way.

Keep putting in the work in a healthy way. Keep your head up. You're doing well. **Be a Forever Learner.**
