This has been the hardest year of my life.

This has been the greatest year of my life.

## Big life changes

Over the last year or so I...

- moved across the country (multiple times)
- left Small Business America
- got back into web development
- met the girl of my dreams
- went hiking for the first (many) times
- navigated health changes in loved ones
- decided I'll give flip flops a chance if it's _that_ hot out
- got married

Lots of changes. Lots of new things. So many new silly things.

**My life now has flavor and spice.**

She's very precious to me.

## Promise fulfilled

I had been praying for a wife for many years. I had been growing as a man and looking forward to the day when I would meet my best friend and embark on the greatest adventure of our lives.

**_That_** finally happened...

> It happened during COVID-19.
>
> It happened during a job market crash.
>
> It happened during isolation mania.
>
> It happened during a time when we weren't supposed to be able to "make it."

It's been difficult. There have been some unique challenges. **Yet, it's been _Good_.**

My heart sings.

## Love and Grace abound

I think when people write these posts online, there are some key events and details regarding the impact that they each have. **My year is less about the events**, of which there have been many that I didn't even list, **and more about a relationship**.

Navigating life with the love of my life has grown and shaped my perspective in ways I can't express.

I have a new lens. I experience life at a new altitude. My understanding of life and those around me has transformed immensely. I can only attribute this to sharing life in a new and great way with someone truly special.

The love and grace we have experienced in the hardest year of our lives has changed us.

Though hardship has been aplenty, grace has been aplenty-er. Maybe I'm most thankful for that.

Oh, that picture above? Yeah...she's the reason we get to see that ðŸ¥°.

I could not be more thankful to have my beautiful wife in my life.

I could not be more thankful for how we support one another on this incredible journey.

2020 has been a beautiful year.
