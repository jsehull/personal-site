Is this even worth it?

How much time will it require?

Where do I get the ideas and inspiration?

Why are there so many half-hearted cheerleaders on the internet telling me to do it for my audience? I don't even have an audience.

Well, I have a few reasons why I'd like to start blogging. For me, **this is an easy win and something that will be beneficial for me in both the short and long-term.**

### Up my writing game

I spent ~~too much~~ enough time writing at university. Notably with minors in history and philosophy, you tend to be _forced_ to write. You learn styles, approaches, and forms of communication, but it's all quite so...scholarly.

Since then, I've grown in communication and correspondence over my business career. My emails have gotten more efficient. My phone calls more clear and concise. My slack chat more...well, less formal ha. But, this blog will be better in a different way.

Now I can focus on a longer form of expression with a **simple and clear delivery that not only conveys the message, but does so with respect to the interest and time of my audience**.

And guess who my audience is?

Me!

### Teaching as a form of learning

I love to learn. Of all the reading and research that I have done for even a simple project like redesigning my personal website, I have learned so much! It's time to share it so I can solidify what I know.

There isn't enough time to share all I've learned, but **reciting key concepts in a professional, yet personal setting can help reinforce what I know as I express it too others**. The more methods of inclusion for learning, the more we can take in (audio, visual, kinesthetic, etc).

Just like in relationships, being able to repeat back what you have heard helps show you know what you said that you know when the other party is trying to understand what you _actually_ know.

### Branching out for topics

There are so many things to write about. I know some writers have specialized their blogs and become a resource for one _specific_ thing. For now, I'm okay with not.

**I want to share my general knowledge and experiences for personal growth.** Doing so allows me to learn about technical subjects, business principles, leadership values, or whatever else is special enough for me to want to take notice. I don't have to be limited to a niche!

\_\_

The power of my blog at this time is that **I can learn what is helping me grow** and by the nature of sharing it, by growing in my writing, by teaching myself as I go, by staying abreast of different topics, I'll keep on keepin' on.

I'll keep being myself, a **forever learner**.
